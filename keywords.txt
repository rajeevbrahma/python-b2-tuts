Operator        | and,or                    | we can use to perform a logical operation
                |                           | and to check if a value is in a list, tuple,
                |                           | etc. and to check if two variables are the same object
                | in                        | we can use to check if a value is in a list, tuple, etc.
                | is                        | we can use to check if two variables are the same object
                | not                       | we can use to reverse the result of a condition           
Control flow    | if, elif, else            | we can use to define a conditional statement
                |                           | conditional statements
Iterative       | for,while                 | These are used for iterative statements like loops
                | break                     | we can use to break a loop
                | continue                  | we can use to continue a loop by skipping the current instance
                                              of the loop

Import          | import                    | we can use to import modules 
                | from                      | we can use to import specific functions from a module
                | as                        | we can use to rename a module / function / class    
                |  pass                     | We can use it in empty control flow / 
                                              empty functions / empty classes
Functions       |  def                      | We can use it to define a function
                | lambda                    | we can use to create an anonymous function
                | return                    | we can use to return a value from a function


Variable        | global                    | we can use to define a variable as globale variable
                | assert                    | we can use to check if a condition is true
                | class                     | we can use to define a class
                | del                       | we can use to delete a variable / object
                | elif                      | we can use to define a conditional statement
                | else                      | we can use to define a conditional statement
                | except                    | we can use to handle exceptions
                | exec                      | we can use to execute a string as code
                | nonlocal                  | we can use to define a variable as nonlocal
                | raise                     | we can use to raise an exception
                | with                      | we can use to define a context manager
                | yield                     | we can use to return a generator
