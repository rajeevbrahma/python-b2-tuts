pre-requisites:
    You should have the github account created with You
Login:
    please login and open settings and go to "ssh and gpg keys" section


step 1 :
    open https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh

step 2 - open your terminal (Mac) / Git Bash (windows)
step 3 - run the command 
        ls -al ~/.ssh  -  Both Mac & windows users
You should see the list of keys
if you creating for the first time you wont have any keys listed
step 4 - run 
    Note : Use the same email id that you have used to signup github 
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C rajeevbrahma@hotmail.com

    You can choose the file name, but if you are doing it for the first time leave it 
    like that dont give any name since i have already one file existed with the 
    same name i am giving a new name.
    Note: remember to give the entire file path, if you are giving any new name

    You can give the password for the key
    its optional 

    If you give any password, it means whenever you want to push the code or pull the code
    from/to remote repository you have to get authenticated using this password 

step 5:
    pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_demo_rsa.pub

now we have successfully pulled the code using the ssh key we have just created.
